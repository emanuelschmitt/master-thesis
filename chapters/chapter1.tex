The utilization of smartphones has become an integral part of our everyday life. We use them to perform various tasks ranging from highly privacy-sensitive tasks such as for bank transactions or personal communication to more casual tasks such as setting an alarm clock or checking the weather. This universal applicability is one important factor that has contributed to the immense success of the smartphone.

% The utilization of smartphones has become an integral part of our everyday life. Smartphones are used for all sorts of tasks ranging from more privacy-sensitive tasks such as bank transactions or personal communication to more casual tasks such as setting an alarm clock or checking the weather. The success of the smartphone is partly due to it's rich set of embodied sensors, such as an accelerometer, digital compass, gyroscope, GPS, microphone and camera \cite{5560598}. These sensor have enabled developers to introduce highly interactive applications providing valuable services to the ever growing smartphone user base.

% Augumented reality ++
Location based services, for instance, utilizing the GPS sensor \cite{link2011footpath} can lead users on the fastest route to their desired destination while health tracking applications \cite{case2015accuracy}, enabled by the motion sensors, can recommend health beneficial behavior based on the amount of physical activity sensed. Furthermore, newly introduced augmented reality applications utilize the camera and the motion sensors to enhance our perception of our immediate surroundings resulting in a whole new interactive experience. As these are positive examples for sensor usage, there have also been reports of sensor utilization with a more malicious intent.

The motion sensors, gyroscope and accelerometer, which are typically used for detecting the device orientation and for gaming applications \cite{feijoo2012mobile}, can be used to infer the locations of touch-screen taps. As the striking force of a tapping finger creates an identifiable signature on the 3-axis motion sensors, previous research has shown that the granularity of inference is adequate to obtain PINs and passwords \cite{Touchlogger, Tapprints, Accessory} or at least significantly reduce the search space to do so. The situation is furthermore reinforced by the fact that motion sensors do not require special privileges or access rights on operation system level. Due to this purpose, the motion sensors expose a vulnerable side-channel for potential attackers to eavesdrop on user interactions.

However, as the motion data used to train the inference systems in the previous research was acquired from users in a controlled setting \cite{Tapprints, Touchlogger, Accessory}, the feasibility of tap location inference has not been shown for a more realistic data set that is capable of modeling natural user behavior as well as their changing environments. It is plausible that when a user interacts with the touch screen, for instance, while walking in the park or during a public transportation ride, the sensory data will be effected by this activity potentially mitigating an eavesdropping attack.

In order to address this issue, I would like to propose \textit{TapSensing}. TapSensing is a data acquisition system designed to acquire tap information with corresponding accelerometer and gyroscope readings. After having conducted a laboratory and field study, I have collected over 45,000 taps from 27 different subjects to investigate if the proposed security threat posed by leaking motion sensor also applies to an uncontrolled environment.

\section{Motivation}

In recent years, the number of smartphone users has rapidly
increased. According to a report published by Smart
Insights\footnote{http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/}, the number of smartphone users grew from 400 million users in 2007, to more than 1,800 million in 2015. In addition, the report claims that at the end of 2017, 97\% of adults, aged 18 to 34, in the US were mobile device users. Due to this rapid adaption and the smartphones rich set of sensors, smartphones have increasingly become targets for various attacks \cite{Colp:2015:PDS:2694344.2694380, Aviv:2010:SAS:1925004.1925009, Touchlogger}.

As gyroscope and accelerometer are commonly used for all genres of applications ranging from gaming \cite{feijoo2012mobile} to productivity apps \cite{pylvanainen2005accelerometer}, the mobile operating system providers offer easy-to-use access via standard APIs\footnote{Application Programming Interface}. Consequently, a smartphone application designed for a real-world attack could sense the user's motion in the background and send the information to a server-side application for machine learning analysis. This is possible due to the fact that background tasks are fully supported on the Android platform while on iOS, methods have been developed to run initially prohibited background tasks\footnote{https://github.com/yarodevuci/backgroundTask} for long durations than usually supported. Notably, all this can be achieved without the user's consent due to the lack of access restriction for motion sensors.

A further point emphasizing the security threat is that in 2017 the World Wide Web Consortium, W3C, has released the so-called Device Orientation specification \cite{w3c} for JavaScript. This specification allows browser applications to access the motion sensor hardware of smartphones opening further possibilities for an attacker. A potentially harmless website could therefore obtain the motion sensor data and reveal private information of the user.

% As the data used for training the inference systems in previous research concerning the topic at hand was collected in a laboratory environment, it is assumed that the data collected in a field environment will be 

Besides all the privacy issues motion sensors raise, tap location inference could also be used for usability research purposes. Assuming that the inference provides high enough accuracies, it could be used as an in-app behavior tracking for applications where the source code is publicly not available. The inference system could run in a background task to evaluate the user behavior in a target application.

\section{Outline}
This work is structured as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Related Work}: In chapter 2, previous research concerning side-channel attacks is presented. As this work is based on similar studies, they will be outlined in this chapter.
  \item \textbf{Machine Learning Fundamentals}: In chapter 3, I will review the machine learning fundamentals required to understand the technical aspects of this thesis. Since learning the relation between the sensory data and the tap location is a supervised learning task, the classification algorithms used in this thesis will be introduced.
  \item \textbf{Data Aquisition System}: In chapter 4, I will introduce \textit{TapSensing} which is the data acquisition system used for obtaining taps and sensor readings for both the laboratory and the field environment.
  \item \textbf{Methodology}: In chapter 5, the methodology of the data acquisition, data pre-processing and machine learning classification is explained.
  \item \textbf{Results}: In chapter 6, meaningful results are presented from the data acquired in the user study.
  \item \textbf{Conclusion}: In the final chapter 7, I will conclude the thesis with an overview of the results and ideas for future studies.

% The rotation of the device is larger when the tap occurs
% at the edge of the device. The linear acceleration of the
% device may also be different, depending on how the finger
% pressure is absorbed by the phone’s metal/glass structure
% and casing. Of course, sensor noise and other factors will
% indeed pollute these signals, and in reality the problem of
% identifying a particular key-press from sensor data alone is
% hard. Nevertheless, theoretically, it should be conceivable
% that finger taps could have a fingerprint.



% Thus, when a user taps on different parts of the screen, it
% is entirely feasible that these taps produce an identifiable
% pattern on the 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope.


% The motion of a smartphone during typing depends on
% several factors: 1) the striking force of the typing finger;
% 2) the resistance force of the supporting hand; 3) the
% landing location of the typing finger; and 4) the location
% of the supporting hand on the smartphone. The first two
% factors mainly affect the shift of the phone, while the latter
% two mainly affects the rotation. We observe that the
% first two factors likely depend on the user, while the latter
% two are likely to be user-independent because (1) on
% each soft keyboard configuration, each key is at a fixed
% location, and (2) a user typically holds her smartphone in
% a consistent way. Therefore, we would like to extract the
% rotation components while filtering out the shift components
% from motion sensor data

% Previous research has shown that it is possible to predict tap locations on a touch screen by utilizing data collected from accelerometer and gyroscope sensor readings \cite{Touchlogger,Tapprints, acc}. However, since the previous work has been limited to using data from a laboratory environment, we would like to investigate if the predictability of tap locations is also applicable to a more realistic data sets. It is plausible that sensor data collected from subjects in the field can include noise making an inference less accurate. To examine these assumptions and to shed light into possible measures effecting these accuracies, we will conduct a laboratory as well as a field study in order to obtain the required data.

% Smartphones are ubiquitous. An ever-expanding consumer base
% carries their handsets everywhere. However, this rapid growth comes
% with new risks. While the proliferation of smartphones equipped
% with high-resolution sensors has afforded developers an opportunity
% to create highly interactive applications, users now rely on their smartphones
% to perform many privacy-sensitive tasks, such as online financial
% transactions and personal communications, that can be eavesdropped
% or exploited. In this paper, we argue that current security
% measures in mobile platforms do not adequately address the malware
% that exploits these high-resolution sensors.
% Current smartphone platforms allow developers access to certain
% hardware sensors (e.g., accelerometers) without requiring special privileges
% or explicit user consent. The security risks posed by microphones
% and cameras have been well documented [18, 21]. However,

% The proliferation of sensors on mobile devices, combined
% with advances in data analytics, has enabled new directions
% in personal computing. The ability to continuously sense
% people-centric data, and distill semantic insights from them,
% is a powerful tool driving a wide range of application domains.
% These domains range from remote patient monitoring,
% to localization, to fine grained context-awareness [16, 3,
% 2, 24]. While this ability to zoom into behavioral patterns
% and activities will only get richer over time, it is not surprising
% that there will be side effects. The research community
% and industry are already facing the ramifications of exposing
% location information; rumor has it that insurance companies
% are on the lookout to mine an individual’s dietary pattern to
% guide insurance cost and coverage. While these kind of side
% effects will continue to surface over time, this paper exposes
% one that may be particularly serious. Briefly, we find that
% sensor information from mobile devices – specifically from
% the accelerometer and gyroscope – can be adequate to infer
% the locations of touch-screen taps. Interpreted differently, a
% background process running on a mobile device may be able
% to silently monitor the accelerometer and gyroscope signals,
% and infer what the user is typing on the software keyboard.
% Needless to say, the ramifications can be monumental.
% This finding may not be surprising when one contemplates
% about it. Modern mobile devices, like smartphones
% and tablets, are being upgraded with sensitive motion sensors,
% mostly to support the rapidly growing gaming industry.
% Thus, when a user taps on different parts of the screen, it
% is entirely feasible that these taps produce an identifiable
% pattern on the 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope. Figure
% 1 illustrates the intuition.

% We show that accelerometer readings are suffi-
% cient to extract sequences of entered text on smartphones. We create
% and evaluate a predictive model, trained only on acceleration
% measurements, of the security-sensitive task of password entry. We
% present findings on the inference accuracy as a function of the sampling
% frequency of the accelerometer, the on-screen location of the
% keypress, and the size of the predicted screen region. Additionally,
% we present measures for mitigating this side channel.
