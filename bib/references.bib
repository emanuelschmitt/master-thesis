    abstract = { Traditional mobile sensing-based applications use extra equipments which are unrealistic for most users. Smartphones develop in a rapid speed in recent years, and they are becoming indispensable carry-on of daily life. The sensors embedded in them provide various possibilities for mobile applications, and these applications are helping and changing the way of our living. In this paper, we analyze and discuss existing mobile applications; after that, future directions are pointed out. }

These emanations are shown to consist of a multiplicity of signals, each leaking somewhat different information about the underlying computation. We show that not only can EM emanations be used to attack cryptographic devices where the power side-channel is unavailable, they can even be used to break power analysis countermeasures.",

	abstract =	{JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data interchange format. It was derived from the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard. JSON defines a small set of formatting rules for the portable representation of structured data. This document removes inconsistencies with other specifications of JSON, repairs specification errors, and offers experience-based interoperability guidance.},
